# TV Hardware Compatibility
The ROOMNET Apple TV solution works with a wide range of TVs. But not all TV support the same technologies and functions.
To help us understand the capabilities of the TVs that are going to be used we need to run a few tests against them.

## Overview
Hospitality specific TVs manufactured from 2016 are the best option as they have functionality and settings specific to the needs of guest rooms.
Retail TVs from LG, and Sony manufactured from 2018 typically work well
Samsung TVs that are not hospitality models (This includes their Professional TVs) manufactured after 2022 feature a device discovery service that cannot be disabled and can cause issues and are genrally not recommended.


## Functionality
The important functions are
- Can the TV be configured to always power on to the Apple TV?
- Are we able to hide any pop ups or overlays that may appear.
- Can we control the TV and Apple TV using [CEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Control) Which allows the Apple TV to be placed anywhere or hidden completley.
- If CEC does not work does the remote control everything using Infra Red?
- Are there any obvious issues with the TV that would cause issues for guests?

!!! info
    If CEC is not a reliable option, the Apple TV will need to placed in a location where the remote control can send it commands. This will need to be considered as part of the room design. 

### Steps to verify TV compatibility

1. Check the TV model number against our [list of tested TVs](tv-compat-matrix.md).
2. If the TV does not appear on our test list, it will need to be tested. Your project manager will arrange this with you.

## Outcomes
Ideally all TV models are supported
