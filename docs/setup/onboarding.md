## Summary

This guide covers onboarding Apple Business Manager enrolled Apple TVs to ROOMNETs Apple TV platform.

## Requirements

!!! info
    You will not be able to start the onboarding process until the basic configuration of your property has been completed by a ROOMNET engineer. Your project manager will confirm when this has been completed.

- All Apple TVs must be enrolled to Apple Business Manager and associated with ROOMNET's MDM platform.
- Physical access to the Apple TVs that require setup.
- Apple TV must have Internet access.
- A device with Internet access and Chrome browser (i.e., Laptop/Smartphone).
- Access to [GLYDE](https://glyde.roomnet.com) and the ability to add devices to the correct property.
- A working remote control. Ideally the ROOMENT remote so it can be configured and tested at the same time.


## Onboarding

1. Log in to [GLYDE](https://glyde.roomnet.com), navigate to the correct property (if multiple are available to you) and select **Activate** from the navigation bar.
2. Power on the Apple TV.
3. The Apple TV will boot to a screen asking you to interact with the remote control. **DO NOT** do anything. After a delay of up to 30 seconds, the Apple TV will automatically configure itself.
4. Once configured, the Apple TV will go to its main menu and the onboarding app will install and launch. If you are stuck on a grey screen, press the back button on the remote several times to show the onboarding app.
5. Enter the code presented on screen into the Activate section of GLYDE and select the room number the Apple TV is being installed in.
6. Click **Register**.
7. On successful registration, you will be taken to the device page. Expand the settings section and set the device name to match the room and location:
8. On successful registration, the Apple TV will reset and go through the auto-configuration process again. When it reaches the main menu, it will install required applications and be ready to use.

!!! info
    When Naming the devices consider how many are installed in each room. If there are multiple name them so they are easily identifiable e.g. Room 101 Bedroom, Room 101 Lounge etc...
    
    This will make it easier for guest who want to airplay content and aid device identification in glyde.
