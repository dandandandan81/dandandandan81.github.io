## Apple MDM Setup

All Apple TVs must be enrolled to an Apple Business manager account. This must be done at point of purchase. If ROOMNET are providing your Apple TV hardware, this section is not relevant. And you can skip to install location.

If You are procuring your Apple TVs they will need to be enrolled to an Apple Business manager account, this must be done at point of purchase. There are two scenarios

### Using your own Business Manager account

If you have an Apple Business Manager account and wish to assign your AppleTVs to it, we will need to link your business manager account to our MDM. Your project manager will discuss the process with you. You can purchase the AppleTVs before the MDM link is complete.

### Using the ROOMNET Business manager account

If you are procuring the Apple TVs but do not have or wish to use your own business manager account, the AppleTVs can be assigned to ROOMNETs account.
Your project manager will provide you with our account ID. We will require the account ID of the reseller you are purchasing from so they can be allowed to assign devices to us.
When purchasing ensure the reseller is informed you want to add the AppleTVs to a business manager account and they have our account ID.

!!! warning
    If this is not completed at point of purchase it will delay the install.
