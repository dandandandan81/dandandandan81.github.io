# Roomnet Install Guide

This has everything you need to get up and Running

## Network Requirements
Understanding and meeting network requirements is essential for delivering a high-quality and reliable service.
Each deployment scenario includes requirements and architectural best practices. Select the configuration that matches the scenario that is being installed. If you are not sure, your project manager will be able to advise.

The ROOMNET AppleTV solution will require more internal and external bandwidth that a traditional Hotel IPTV system, this is due to the breadth of apps and functionality available to guests that is not possible with traditional solutions.
AppleTVs also prefer a Gigabit network connection, most TV Hardware maxes out at 100MB. This can hi-light old or damaged wiring that is not upto maintaining a gigabit link.

### Deployment Scenarios
We've organized our network requirements into distinct deployment scenarios, each addressing specific use cases and infrastructure considerations:

- [Network **Without** Multicast](../setup/unicast.md) There is either no Live TV or the Live TV is provided over the Internet.
- [Network **With** Multicast](../setup/multicast.md) The ROOMNET Live TV will be used, TV channels are provided via local multicast streams
- [AppleTVs on Wifi](../setup/wifi.md) A specialist setup for poperties that have no wired option in the guest room.
