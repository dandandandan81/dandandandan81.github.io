The design is simple, containing only the required buttons and nothing more. The Remote supports hundreds of TV brands but works best when controlling Hospitality specific TVs. In most scenarios the remote will communicate directly with the TV emulating the behaviour of the TVs factory remote. In the recommended configuration, navigation commands are sent via the TV to the Apple TV allowing the Apple TV to be hidden or placed as required. This is achieved using a feature built into most TVs called CEC.</p> <p>There may be scenarios where this function does not work correctly or is not supported by your TV. In this case the remote can talk to the Apple TV directly, but this requires a line of sight between the remote and the Apple TV to work reliably.</p>"},{"location":"user-guides/remote-control/#using-the-remote","title":"Using the remote","text":""},{"location":"user-guides/remote-control/#setting-up-the-remote","title":"Setting up the remote","text":"<p>Information on programming the remote control is available in the remote control setup guide</p>"},{"location":"user-guides/reset/","title":"Reset App","text":""},{"location":"user-guides/reset/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Although we erase all guest data on checkout, some guests may be more security concious and waht to make sure their data is gone before they leave the room.
